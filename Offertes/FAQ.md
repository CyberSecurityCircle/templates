## Pentest FAQ 

* What is the difference between Crystal Box and Black Box testing?
```
Basically, the difference between Crystal Box, Gray Box, and Black Box pentesting 
is the amount of knowledge the testers have on the target environment, architecture, 
and/or applications. Block Box Testing has the least (or no) information on the targest. 
It's like the targets are inside a black box and the testers have to figure out how to 
get inside. Crystal Box Testing is when the testers have a considerable amount of 
knowledge about the target(s), like they're inside a see-through box. They can see 
exactly what's there, so it's easier for them to find vulnerabilities. A Grey Box 
is in between the two. Although a malicious attacker will know little to no information 
(unless it's an inside job) about the environment/applications, it's often beneficial 
to do a Crystal Box so the targets can be more thoroughly tested for vulnerabilites.
