        <p>Our general approach during this penetration test was as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Reconnaissance</b><br/>
	    We attempted to gather as much information as possible about the target. Reconnaissance can
	    take two forms: active and passive. Passive reconnaissance is always the best starting point as
	    this is not touching the target systems in any suspicious way, and is therefore (nearly) impossible
	    to detect. Passive reconnaisance uses publicly available information, e.g. from DNS, WHOIS,
	    Chamber of Commerce, performing searches in regular search engines such as Google, but
	    also datasources specialized in IT security information such as Shodan and censys.io. If social
	    engineering is involved, passive reconnaisance also involves gathering information about people
	    working for or dealing with the target, using public sources like social media and search engines.
	    Active forms of reconnaissance use techniques like scanning and fingerprinting, which show up
	    in audit logs, and trigger IDS and SIEM systems protecting the target. Active reconnaissance with
	    social engineering involves contacting people within the target or affiliated organizations, which
	    may raise suspicion.
            </li>
            <li><b>Enumeration</b><br/>We used varied operating system fingerprinting tools to determine
                what hosts are alive on the network and more importantly what services and operating
                systems they are running. Research into these services would then be carried out to
                tailor the test to the discovered services.</li>
            <li><b>Scanning</b><br/>By use of vulnerability scanners all discovered hosts would be tested
                for vulnerabilities. The result would then be analyzed to determine if there any
                vulnerabilities that could be exploited to gain access to a target host on a
                network.</li>
            <li><b>Obtaining Access</b><br/>By use of published exploits or weaknesses found in
                applications, operating system and services access would then be attempted. This may
                be done surreptitiously or by more brute force methods.</li>
        </ol>

        <title>Risk Classification</title>
        <p>Throughout the document, each vulnerability or risk identified has been labeled and
            categorized as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Extreme</b><br/>Extreme risk of security controls being compromised with the possibility
                of catastrophic financial/reputational losses occurring as a result.</li>
            <li><b>High</b><br/>High risk of security controls being compromised with the potential for
                significant financial/reputational losses occurring as a result.</li>
            <li><b>Elevated</b><br/>Elevated risk of security controls being compromised with the potential
                for material financial/reputational losses occurring as a result.</li>
            <li><b>Moderate</b><br/>Moderate risk of security controls being compromised with the potential
                for limited financial/reputational losses occurring as a result.</li>
            <li><b>Low</b><br/>Low risk of security controls being compromised with measurable negative
                impacts as a result.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please note that this risk rating system was taken from the Penetration Testing Execution
            Standard (PTES). For more information, see:
