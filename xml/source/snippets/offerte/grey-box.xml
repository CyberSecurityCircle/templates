  Crystal-box vs. black-box pentesting refers to the amount of information about the target environment, architecture, and/or applications the customer initially shares with the pentesters. With black-box testing, pentesters are given no information whatsoever about the target(s). With crystal-box testing, pentesters are given all information requested about the target(s), including source-code (when relevant), access to developers or system management, etc.
