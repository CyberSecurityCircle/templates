  Crystal Box vs. Black Box pentesting refers to the amount of information
  regarding the target environment, architecture, and/or applications that is initially
  shared by the customer with the pentesters. With Black Box testing, pentesters
  are given no information whatsoever about the target(s). With Crystal Box testing,
  pentesters are given all information requested about the target(s), including 
  source code (when relevant), access to developers or system management, etc. In this case <company_short/> will conduct a Black Box test.
