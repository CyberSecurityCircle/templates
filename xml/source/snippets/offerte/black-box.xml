  <!--snippet -->Crystal-Box vs. Black-Box pentesting refers to the amount of information
  about the target environment, architecture, and/or applications that the customer 
  initially shares with the pentesters. With Black-Box testing, pentesters
  are given no information whatsoever about the target(s). With Crystal-Box testing,
  pentesters are given all information requested about the target(s), including 
  source code (when relevant), access to developers or system management, etc..
<br />
<br />
  In this case <company_short/> will conduct a Black-Box test.
