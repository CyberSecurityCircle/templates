  Crystal Box vs. Black Box pentesting refers to the amount of information regarding the
  target environment, architecture, and/or applications that is initially shared by the
  customer with the pentesters.  With Black Box testing, pentesters are given no information
  whatsoever about the target(s). With Crystal Box testing, pentesters are given all information
  requested about the target(s), including source-code (when relevant), access 
  to developers or system management, etc. <company_short/> will conduct Crystal Box pentesting, which is the preferred method. Unlike real-world
  attackers, who have all of the time in the world, penetration testing tends to happen within
  a limited time frame. Crystal Box pentesting allows us to make the most efficient use of the
  time allotted, thus maximizing the number of vulnerabilities that can be found. Additionally
  Crystal Box pentesting fits naturally hand-in-hand with the "Peek Over Our Shoulder"
  option that <company_short/> offers to <c_short/>.
