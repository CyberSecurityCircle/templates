    <title>Weak SSL Certificate Signature Algorithm</title>

    <description>
        <p>The SSL certificate's signature algorithm is considered to be weak.</p>
    </description>

	<!-- Replace WEAKALGORIHM with the actual algorithm and describe why it is considered to be weak.  -->
    <technicaldescription>
        <p>The target server's certificate signature algorithm is WEAKALGORITHM. This algorithm is considered to be weak. <!-- It is weak, because.. --> </p>

        <p>The signature algorithm can be retrieved with openSSL:</p>
        <pre>openssl s_client -connect target &lt; /dev/null 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -text -in /dev/stdin | grep "Signature Algorithm"</pre>

	<!-- What is the impact? Man-in-the-iddle attacks, manipulating HTTPS traffic? (When) Can a certificate be cloned? Please include web resources with further information, if possible. -->
    <impact>
        <p></p>
    </impact>

	<!-- Please recommend a strong certification algorithm, such as SHA256withRSA (as of August 2015). -->
    <recommendation>
        <p>Change the next issued certificate's signature algorithm from WEAKALGORITHM to a stronger algorithm. We recommend using RECOMMENDATION.</p>
