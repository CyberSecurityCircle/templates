<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt"><fo:inline font-weight="bold">Step 1: Requirements Gathering and Scoping</fo:inline> <fo:block/>
The expectations of both parties are discussed and agreements are made regarding 
how to conduct the test(s). For example, contact details and the pentest's scope 
are documented.</fo:block>

<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt"><fo:inline font-weight="bold">Step 2: Discovery</fo:inline><fo:block/>
As much information as possible about the target organization and target objects 
is collected. This information is passively gathered, primarily from public sources.</fo:block>

<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt"><fo:inline font-weight="bold">Step 3: Validation</fo:inline><fo:block/>
All customer-specified systems are cross-referenced with findings from the 
Discovery step. We do this to ensure that discovered systems are legal property 
of the customer and to verify the scope with the customer.</fo:block>

<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt"><fo:inline font-weight="bold">Step 4: Information Collection</fo:inline><fo:block/>
Information from Step 2 is now used to actively collect information about the 
system. Activities conducted during this phase may include:
Determining which parts of the various components will be investigated;
Testing for the presence of known vulnerabilities, using automated tests;
Identifying the offered services and fingerprinting the software used for them.</fo:block>

<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt"><fo:inline font-weight="bold">Step 5: Threat and Vulnerability Analysis</fo:inline><fo:block/>
Potential threats and vulnerabilities are indexed, based upon the collected information.</fo:block>

<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt"><fo:inline font-weight="bold">Step 6: Exploitation</fo:inline><fo:block/>
Attempt to use vulnerabilities of the various components. 
The diverse applications and components of the client's infrastructure are 
relentlessly probed for frequently occurring design, configuration, and 
programming errors.</fo:block>

<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">Note: Radically Open Security B.V. uses open-source scanning tools to get its bearings, 
but generally performs most of the exploitation by hand.</fo:block>

<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt"><fo:inline font-weight="bold">Step 7: Reporting</fo:inline><fo:block/>
After finishing the audit, a report will be delivered where the step-by-step 
approach, results, and discovered vulnerabilities are described. The report and 
results will be presented to the responsible project leader or manager at the 
client's office.</fo:block>

<fo:block margin-bottom="1.5cm" line-height="18pt">Steps 4-6 may be repeated multiple times per test. For example, access may be 
acquired in an external system, which serves as a stepping-stone to the internal network. 
The internal network will then be explored in Steps 4 and 5, and exploited in Step 6.</fo:block>

<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">
  Crystal-box vs. black-box pentesting refers to the amount of information about the target environment, architecture, and/or applications the customer initially shares with the pentesters. With black-box testing, pentesters are given no information whatsoever about the target(s). With crystal-box testing, pentesters are given all information requested about the target(s), including source-code (when relevant), access to developers or system management, etc.
</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="1.5cm" line-height="18pt">
  ROS will conduct crystal-box pentesting, which is the preferred 
  method. Unlike real-world attackers who have all of the time in the world, 
  penetration testing tends to happen within a limited time frame. Crystal-box 
  pentesting allows us to make the most efficient use of the time allotted, thus 
  maximizing the number of vulnerabilities that can be found. Additionally
  crystal-box pentesting fits naturally hand-in-hand with the "Peek Over Our Shoulder" option that ROS offers to Sitting Duck.

    <fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">ROS will perform a code audit to aid pentesting. During a 
    code audit, we manually examine the code of an application to ensure there 
    are no security vulnerabilities and use our understanding of the code to 
    guide our pentesting. If vulnerabilities are found, we document those and 
    suggest ways to fix them. This is done by highly-trained penetration testers 
    who can both review the raw code as well as interpret the findings of the 
    automated scans, putting them into context.</fo:block>
	<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">During the code audit portion of penetration tests, we take the following 
	criteria into account:</fo:block>

		In this step, we analyze the risks of a particular application or system. 
		Threat Modeling is a specific, structured approach to risk analysis that 
		enables us to identify, qualify, and address the security risks, thus 
		dovetailing with the Code Review process. For example, user data is 
		sacred. We focus on encrypted storage, discover if Sitting Duck employees 
		have a backdoor into data, and cut loose stolen devices by wiping them 
		remotely and revoking accounts.</fo:block></fo:list-item-body></fo:list-item><fo:list-item margin-bottom="5pt"><fo:list-item-label end-indent="label-end()"><fo:block>2. </fo:block></fo:list-item-label><fo:list-item-body start-indent="body-start()"><fo:block>Purpose and Context<fo:block/>
		Here we focus on risks, especially in the quick and easy sharing of 
		internal documents and itineraries. Account details aren't so secret 
		when we know who will be in meetings, but what's being discussed is secret.</fo:block></fo:list-item-body></fo:list-item><fo:list-item margin-bottom="5pt"><fo:list-item-label end-indent="label-end()"><fo:block>3. </fo:block></fo:list-item-label><fo:list-item-body start-indent="body-start()"><fo:block>Complexity<fo:block/>
		The complexity of the system is in the frameworks that support the web 
		application. We'd ignore those and focus only on the custom code and 
		backend code, which we understand is based on .NET/ C#. We would also 
		focus on implementation mistakes and known flaws in the systems. For 
		example, we'd ensure you're using the latest versions of software, 
		but we wouldn't delve into the framework itself. Since we assume the 
		code is written by a team, it should be clearly-written code. If you have 
		several full-release versions, there will undoubtedly be several revisions 
		and audits on that code.</fo:block></fo:list-item-body></fo:list-item></fo:list-block>

	<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">Radically Open Security B.V. is the world's first not-for-profit computer security consultancy. 
	We operate under an innovative new business model whereby we use a Dutch fiscal 
	entity, called a “Fiscaal Fondswervende Instelling” (Fiscal Fund raising Institution), 
	as a commercial front-end to send 90% of our profits, tax-free, to a not-for-profit 
	foundation, Stichting NL net. The NLnet Foundation has supported open-source, 
	digital rights, and Internet research for almost 20 years.</fo:block>

	<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">In contrast to other organizations, our profits do not benefit shareholders, 
	investors, or founders. Our profits benefit society. As an  
	organization without a profit-motive, we recruit top-name, ethical security 
	experts and find like-minded customers that want to use their IT security 
	budget as a "vote" to support socially responsible entrepreneurship. The rapid 
	pace of our current growth reflects the positive response the market has to our 
	idealistic philosophy and innovative business model.</fo:block>

        <fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt"><fo:inline font-weight="bold">What is this document?</fo:inline></fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">These are the general terms and conditions (in Dutch: “<fo:inline font-style="italic">algemene voorwaarden</fo:inline>”) 
of Radically Open Security B.V. (ROS). This version of the general terms and conditions 
is dated 15 July 2014.</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">In the spirit of ROS's philosophy, ROS wants these 
general terms and conditions to be as understandable as possible. If you have any 
questions, feel free to ask for clarification.</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt"><fo:inline font-weight="bold">What is Radically Open Security B.V.?</fo:inline></fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">ROS is a private limited liability company under Dutch law located 
in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. It is registered at the Dutch Chamber of Commerce 
under no. 60628081.</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt"><fo:inline font-weight="bold">To what do these terms and conditions apply?</fo:inline></fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">These general terms and conditions apply to all agreements between ROS 
and the customer. ROS rejects any terms and conditions used by the 
customer. The parties can only deviate from these general terms and conditions 
in writing. These general terms and conditions are also intended to benefit any 
person employed or engaged by ROS during the performance of an assignment.</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt"><fo:inline font-weight="bold">How does ROS agree on an assignment?</fo:inline></fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">ROS wants both parties to have a clear picture of an assignment 
before it starts. This means there only is an agreement between ROS 
and the customer after ROS sends a written offer containing the key 
terms of the agreement and the customer subsequently accepts the offer. 
Communications other than the written offer do not form part of the agreement. 
ROS can rescind an offer until it is accepted by the customer.</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt"><fo:inline font-weight="bold">What can the customer expect from ROS?</fo:inline></fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">It is important to understand the limits of ROS's services. 
ROS does not (and cannot) give guarantees that something is secure. 
ROS instead has an obligation to make reasonable efforts 
(in Dutch: “<fo:inline font-style="italic">inspanningsverplichting</fo:inline>”) to perform the agreed services.</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">ROS will make reasonable efforts to perform the assignment in 
accordance with the plan set out in the offer (if any). If ROS 
expects it will not fulfill the plan as documented, it will let the customer 
know without delay. ROS is not automatically deemed to be in default 
if it doesn't meet the plan.</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">ROS will make reasonable efforts to avoid disruption of the 
customer's operations and damage to its owned or operated systems, but it 
cannot guarantee that this will be avoided. The customer agrees 
to this. ROS is not obliged to restore the systems or recover any 
data deleted or amended in the course of the assignment.</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt"><fo:inline font-weight="bold">What can ROS expect from the customer?</fo:inline></fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">The customer will provide ROS with all means necessary to allow 
ROS to perform the agreed services. If ROS needs explicit 
permission from the customer to perform its services (for example, when doing 
penetration tests) the customer gives this permission. The customer also warrants 
that it has the legal authority to give this permission.</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt"><fo:inline font-weight="bold">How do the parties handle confidential information?</fo:inline></fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">ROS and the customer will not disclose to others confidential 
information and personal data they receive from each other or gain access to in 
the course of an assignment. ROS has the right to disclose this 
information and data to persons engaged by ROS, but only if these 
persons have a similar confidentiality obligation vis-á-vis ROS.
Any person will only use the information and dataa it receives or gains access 
to for the purposes following from the agreement. Both parties will take reasonable 
measures to maintain the confidentiality of the information and data they received 
or gained access to, and will ensure that persons engaged by them do the same.</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt"><fo:inline font-weight="bold">What does ROS do with vulnerabilities it finds in the course 
of an assignment?</fo:inline></fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">If ROS in the course of an assignment finds a vulnerability which 
might affect the customer, it will report this to the customer. If a vulnerability 
might affect third parties as well, ROS retains the right to disclose 
this vulnerability also to others than the customer. It will only do so after 
having given the customer a reasonable period to take measures minimising the 
impact of the vulnerability, in line with responsible disclosure best practices.</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt"><fo:inline font-weight="bold">What does ROS do with indicators of compromise it finds?</fo:inline></fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">If ROS in the course of an assignment finds indicators of 
compromise, such as malware signatures and IP-addresses, it will report this to 
the customer. ROS retains the right to also publish this information 
in a publicly accessible database. It will only do so after it has given the 
customer the opportunity to object to the publication of data which would 
negatively impact the customer.</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt"><fo:inline font-weight="bold">Who owns the products developed in the course of the assignment?</fo:inline></fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">ROS retains any intellectual property rights in products developed 
for an assignment, such as software and reports. ROS, however, wants 
to teach as many customers as possible 'how to fish'.</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">For software it developed, this means that ROS gives the customer 
a permanent, non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to 
distribute and use the software in source and binary forms, with or without 
modification (very similar to the BSD-license). If ROS's software 
is based on other software which is provided under a license which restricts 
ROS's ability to license its own software (such as the GPLv3 license), 
the more restrictive license will apply.</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">For other products it developed, such as reports and analyses, ROS 
gives the customer the same license, but this license is exclusive to the customer 
and does not contain the right to modification. The latter condition is intended 
to ensure that the customer will not change ROS's products, such as 
reports and analyses. ROS retains the right to reuse these products, 
for example for training and marketing purposes. ROS will remove any 
confidential information from these products before publication.</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">ROS retains title to any property transferred to the customer 
until all outstanding payments by the customer have been done in full (in Dutch: 
“<fo:inline font-style="italic">eigendomsvoorbehoud</fo:inline>”). ROS also only gives a license after 
all outstanding payments have been done in full.</fo:block> 
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt"><fo:inline font-weight="bold">Who will perform the assignment?</fo:inline></fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">ROS has the right to appoint the persons who will perform the 
assignment. It has the right to replace a person with someone with at least the 
same expertise, but only after having consulted with the customer. This means 
that section 7:404 Dutch Civil Code (in Dutch: “<fo:inline font-style="italic">Burgerlijk Wetboek</fo:inline>”) is 
excluded.</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">Due to the nature of ROS's business, ROS regularly 
works with freelancers for the performance of its assignments. ROS 
has the right to engage third parties, including freelancers, in the course of 
the performance of an assignment.</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">ROS wants to be able to use the expertise of its entire team to 
help with an assignment. This means that in the course of an assignment, it is 
possible that the persons performing the assignment will consult with and be 
advised by others in ROS's team. These others will of course be 
bound by the same confidentiality obligations as the persons performing the assignment.</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt"><fo:inline font-weight="bold">What happens when the scope of the assignment is bigger than agreed?</fo:inline></fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">ROS and the customer will attempt to precisely define the scope 
of the assignment before ROS starts. If during the course of the 
assignment, the scope turns out to be bigger than expected, ROS 
will report this to the customer and make a written offer for the additional work.</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt"><fo:inline font-weight="bold">How is payment arranged?</fo:inline></fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">All amounts in ROS's offers are in Euros, excluding VAT and 
other applicable taxes, unless agreed otherwise.</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">For assignments where the parties agreed to an hourly fee, ROS 
will send an invoice after each month. For other assignments, ROS 
will send an invoice after completion of the assignment, and at moments set out 
in the offer (if any). The customer must pay an invoice within 30 days of the 
invoice date.</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">ROS may, prior to an assignment, agree on the payment of a 
deposit by the customer. ROS will settle deposits with interim 
payments or the final invoice for the assignment.</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">If the payment is not received before the agreed term, the client will be 
deemed to be in default without prior notice. ROS will then have 
the right to charge the statutory interest (in Dutch: “<fo:inline font-style="italic">wettelijke rente</fo:inline>”) 
and any judicial and extrajudicial (collection) costs (in Dutch: 
“<fo:inline font-style="italic">gerechtelijke- en buitengerechtelijke (incasso)kosten</fo:inline>”).</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">If the customer cancels or delays the assignment two weeks before it starts, 
ROS is entitled to charge the customer 50% of the agreed price. 
If the customer cancels or delays the assignment after it already started, 
ROS is entitled to charge the customer 100% of the agreed price. 
ROS is entitled to charge a pro rata percentage in the case of
cancellation or delay shorter than two weeks before the start of the assignment 
(i.e. a cancellation one week before the assignment would entitle ROS 
to charge 75% of the agreed price).</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt"><fo:inline font-weight="bold">For what can ROS be held liable?</fo:inline></fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">Any liability of ROS resulting from or related to the performance 
of an assignment, shall be limited to the amount that is paid out in that 
specific case under an applicable indemnity insurance of ROS, 
if any, increased by the amount of the applicable deductible (in Dutch: 
“<fo:inline font-style="italic">eigen risico</fo:inline>”) which under that insurance shall be borne by ROS. 
If no amount is paid out under an insurance, these damages are limited to the 
amount already paid for the assignment, with a maximum of EUR 10.000.
Each claim for damages shall expire after a period of one month from the day 
following the day on which the customer became aware or could reasonably 
be aware of the existence of the damages.</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">To make things clear, ROS is not liable if a person associated 
with ROS acts contrary to any confidentiality or non-compete 
obligation vis-á-vis the customer or a third party, this person might have 
agreed to in another engagement.</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">What happens when third parties lodge a claim or initiate criminal proceedings 
against ROS?</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">The customer shall indemnify ROS and any person employed or 
engaged by ROS for any claims of third parties which are in any 
way related to the activities of ROS and any person employed or 
engaged by ROS for the customer.</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">Should a third party lodge a claim against ROS or any of the 
consultants it engaged or employed as a result of the performance of the assignment 
for the customer, then the customer will co-operate fully with ROS 
in defending against this claim, including by providing to ROS any 
evidence it has which relates to this claim.
Should the public prosecutor initiate an investigation or criminal proceedings 
against ROS or any of the consultants it engaged or employed as a 
result of the performance of the assignment for the customer, then the customer 
will also co-operate fully with ROS in defending against this 
investigation or proceedings, including by providing any evidence it has which 
relates to this investigation or these proceedings.</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">The customer shall reimburse ROS and any person employed or 
engaged by ROS all costs of legal defence and all damages in 
relation to these claims, investigations or proceedings. This provision does 
not apply to the extent a claim, investigation, or proceeding is the result of 
the intent or recklessness (in Dutch: “<fo:inline font-style="italic">opzet of bewuste roekeloosheid</fo:inline>”) 
of ROS or a person employed or engaged by ROS.</fo:block>

<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">Each of the parties may terminate the agreement wholly or partly without 
prior notice if the other party is declared bankrupt or is being wound up or if 
the other party's affairs are being administered by the court 
(in Dutch: “surséance van betaling”).</fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt"><fo:inline font-weight="bold">When can ROS not be expected to perform the assignment?</fo:inline></fo:block>
<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">In the case of force majeure (in Dutch: “<fo:inline font-style="italic">overmacht</fo:inline>”) as a result of 
which ROS cannot reasonably be expected to perform the assignment, 
the performance will be suspended. Situations of force majeure include cases 
where means, such as soft- and hardware, which are prescribed by the customer 
do not function well. The agreement may be terminated by either party if a 
situation of force majeure has continued longer than 90 days. The customer will 
then have to pay the amount for the work already performed pro rata.</fo:block>

<fo:block margin-bottom="10pt" line-height="18pt">Dutch law applies to the legal relationship between ROS and its

in the first instance exclusively by the District Court (in Dutch:
